He ascended to the throne after leading a rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty, driven by the abduction of his betrothed, Lyanna Stark, by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. This event, known as Robert's Rebellion, resulted in the overthrow of King Aerys II Targaryen, also known as the Mad King. After Lyanna's death during the war, Robert married Cersei Lannister to solidify his claim to the throne and unite powerful families. Despite his status as king, Robert's reign is marked by his disinterest in ruling and his indulgence in pleasures, which eventually lead to political instability and his untimely death.</p>
